array-insert-shift

## Whiteboard Process
![CodeChallenge](./Code%20Challenge%2002.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
I started by defining the input array and value, and what the function will must do and then walked through each step of the algorithm 

## Solution
The function modifies the input array by inserting the new value val at the midpoint index, and shifting the elements after the midpoint to the right by one position. The function then returns the modified array, which we print to the console.
## how run the project
