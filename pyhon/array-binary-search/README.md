## Approach & Efficiency
Approach:

The function uses a for loop to iterate through each element of the input array arr. It then checks if the current element is equal to the target value val. If a match is found, the index of the element is stored in a variable called index and the loop is broken using the break keyword. If the loop completes without finding a match, the index variable remains equal to -1 and is returned by the function.

Efficiency:

Time complexity: The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array arr.
